            %a{href: "blogpost.html"} Christian Resiliency in the Face of Anorexia Recovery
          %p
            %a{href: "blogpost.html"} I promised to post about my January doctor’s appointment in a recent post. So in order to give you a picture of what’s really behind my skin, I’ll try to be as honest as possible.

          %h3.card__small__header Let’s Talk About the Heart
          %p Let’s talk about what’s on the inside versus outside of a person. I have a few things on my heart today. The first is my sister-in-law and her family who lost their brother/son in an accident a year ago today. I didn’t know him well, but I love his sister and his parents. They’ve been family for a long time. They’re good people, and they neither deserve nor want to be on the journey they’re on.

          %h3.card__small__header Martin Luther King Jr.’s Dream Lives On: We Can be Models of Christ’s Love Too
          %p I’d planned on posting something different for this next post, but I just dropped my youngest off at preschool, and the parents of my son’s classmate had printed off a poem I just had to share below.

          %h3.card__small__header National Eating Disorders Awareness Week
          %p This week is National Eating Disorders Awareness week. Did you know that of all mental health issues, anorexia has the number one mortality rate? NEDA (National Eating Disorders Association) says, “3 minutes can save a life.”

          %h3.card__small__header When Your Physical Shape Returns, People Expect You to be Well, but That’s Not Always How Anorexia Works
          %p Beginning the week before Christmas week, I started struggling again. I didn’t want to post because I didn’t want to be vulnerable. The truth is, recovery is hell.

          %h3.card__small__header What Does it Mean To Be Made in the Image of Christ?
          %p I read an amazing book for my Vineyard Institute Biblical Metanarrative class called The Biblical Metanarrative: One God, One Plan, One Story by my late professor, Bill Jackson. Near the end, he includes a long, anonymous quote which just takes my breath away. It’s about what it means to be made into the image of Christ. As you will see, this takes death to self, spiritually speaking. Before you read this, ask yourself if you live for yourself or for God or both.
