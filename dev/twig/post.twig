                <div class="entry-content clearfix">
                    <p>I&#8217;m a scientific technical editor, and as I edited a scientific journal article two days ago, I came across the word,
                        <em>excelling</em>. I looked it up in Merriam Webster simply because I couldn&#8217;t remember if it was with one l or two l&#8217;s. While on their website, I read the definition. Here&#8217;s what I read:<span id="more-560"></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Simple defn of
                        <em>excel</em>:</p>
                    <p>~to be better than others</p>
                    <p>~to be or do better than (others)</p>
                    <p>Full defn of
                        <em>excel</em>:</p>
                    <p>~to be superior to : surpass in accomplishment or achievement (transitive verb)</p>
                    <p>~to be distinguishable by superiority : surpass others (intransitive verb)</p>
                    <p>I cringed as I read those definitions, and I thought:
                        <em>that sounds like an American definition.</em>
                        Maybe
                        <em>excel</em>
                        has always meant being better than someone else, but seriously. Why can&#8217;t someone excel at something without there having to be a comparison? I
                        <em>excel</em>
                        at a lot of things, but I don&#8217;t believe it has to mean I am better at those things than others. Why can&#8217;t I just be good at them and excel in and of myself and not because I&#8217;m better?</p>
                    <p>Our culture needs to get past the thought that we always have to compare ourselves to others. Honestly, that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t have a personal account on Facebook right now. Comparison is in your face. Being off FB has helped me
                        tremendously. Why don&#8217;t we use God rather than other people as our measuring stick? When we compare ourselves to others, it&#8217;s a matter of pride or jealousy (or envy, shame). Pride says: well, at least I&#8217;m better at this or more fit
                        than that person. Jealousy says: well, I&#8217;m not as good at this or as attractive as that person. I want what they have, and I will do what I can to get it. Envy says: I want what they have, and I hate them because I know I&#8217;ll never have
                        it. Shame says: I should be better, I should be like them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Whose measuring stick do we use? And if it&#8217;s not God&#8217;s, who standardized it?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p><blockquote>Is either end of the spectrum <strong>beneficial</strong>? Is either response what God wants us to have?</blockquote></p>
                    <p>Comparison is the devil. It robs us of peace and joy.</p>
                    <p><blockquote>Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to wake up in the morning with joy in whom God is and whom He&#8217;s created us to be? Circumstances change constantly, that&#8217;s why happiness is like vapor. We can be happy, but it dissipates. We can have joy
                        regardless of our circumstances because it&#8217;s based on truth. Jesus said He is the way, and the
                        <em>truth</em>, and the life (John 14:6) (emphasis mine). We can have joy no matter what because of the hope we have in Jesus.</p>
                    <p>Right now, I&#8217;m looking for joy in my circumstances because I&#8217;m not happy. You know how some things are still a shock to your system despite knowing they&#8217;re coming? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve experienced the past two days.
                        I&#8217;ve gone from sadness to anger to anxiety.</blockquote></p>
                    <p>An OB had me start taking birth control because we found out I had two very painful cysts and we&#8217;re trying to break them up. And though I&#8217;ve had menses for four months straight, I basically didn&#8217;t this past month despite being on
                        the pill. This a big, red flag in the anorexia world. I had a doctor&#8217;s appointment two days ago and knew I needed to tell him.</p>
                    <p>Combine this with the fact that I dropped out of the weight range they&#8217;ve set for me. Not that they&#8217;ve told me the range, but I have an idea. It&#8217;s within a normal weight range for my height but higher than I would normally be if
                        I weren&#8217;t battling or recovering from anorexia. And I don&#8217;t like the range. I want to be lower. Go figure. Medically, everything else checked out. I wasn&#8217;t orthostatic, my pulse was normal, and all my blood work was okay. The only
                        thing was that my BUN/creatinine ratio was higher than the normal range, but I&#8217;ve always struggled with hydration.</p>
                    <p>My doctor&#8217;s appointment was immediately followed up by a counseling appointment. I was already emotional, so I decided to be honest about my feelings. This is hard for me. I&#8217;m still in counseling actually because I have such a hard
                        time not numbing out my intense emotions.</p>
                    <p>I had a pastor tell me eight years ago, &#8220;You&#8217;re somewhere between brittle and fragile.&#8221; She&#8217;s an INTJ; I&#8217;m an INFJ. Her head dug a wound in my heart. One thing I&#8217;m realizing is that our initial feelings are
                        involuntary. They&#8217;ve been shaped by temperament, environment, history, etc. And our feelings are often wrapped up in our core identity. I believe, there&#8217;s something important the pastor missed when she spoke those words to me. Her
                        statement may have been accurate, and my reaction to her words which led to her making that statement was inappropriate. But I believe she missed the comma with the second independent clause. She could have said, &#8220;You&#8217;re somewhere between
                        brittle and fragile<strong>, and that&#8217;s okay because it&#8217;s where you&#8217;re at right now.</strong>&#8221;</p>
                    <p>People have feelings for a reason. The feelings may or may not be appropriate, but we validate people when we acknowledge their right to have their feelings. They own their feelings. And they can turn them over to God if they&#8217;re not
                        appropriate. I&#8217;ve struggled with opening myself up to my counselor despite seeing her for a year and a half now. We had a breakthrough in April because I wrote her an e-mail expressing my feelings about something, and she in turn validated me
                        as a person despite the way I expressed my intense feelings. She
                        <em>saw</em>
                        me through my feelings. She didn&#8217;t reject me, she accepted me and the feelings that were part of me.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Keep in mind when we reject someone&#8217;s feelings, it can appear we&#8217;re in essence rejecting who they are. We love someone when we can see their God-given potential despite their abraded edges. Don&#8217;t criticize without construction.
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>To overcome anorexia, you have to make the decision to eat. I&#8217;ve been doing that. I saw my dietician yesterday and became upset when I found out they&#8217;re actually adjusting my meal plan. I expected to just be required to eat more within
                        my current meal plan, with which I would have been okay with me, but now I have to eat more either at every meal or essentially have an extra meal a day. When I walked out of the Center yesterday, I experienced deep chest pains. Anxiety. I
                        hadn&#8217;t felt like that in a while.</p>
                    <p>I&#8217;m sad, angry, and upset about being in this position again without having relapsed. I&#8217;m upset they won&#8217;t give me another month to see how everything checks out. I&#8217;m envious of those who can diet or eat much less than me
                        because they don&#8217;t have an eating disorder attached to their person, their history, their soul. I want to shout to those who are teetering on health and eating disorder and tell them either way, it&#8217;s a lose-lose situation. You lose if you
                        lose weight, and you can lose your health and life. But if you end up down that road and embark on recovery, you lose because you&#8217;ve probably destroyed your set point and now have to weigh more to be healthy than you would have otherwise thanks
                        to anorexia.</p>
                    <p>I know I need to gain fat. Probably the reason I&#8217;m the most upset is that I don&#8217;t believe I look like I&#8217;m too thin. And many people have told me I look good, so I know it&#8217;s not just my AN talking. I don&#8217;t look like
                        I&#8217;m wasting away, and I don&#8217;t want to look like that again. So gaining fat is really counter-intuitive. But like I said, eating disorders destroy and change our bodies. To get my body healthy, I have to gain fat. To gain fat means I need
                        to gain weight. I don&#8217;t like the way they&#8217;re having me go about it.</p>
                    <p>Can I do it?</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Walking in obedience comes only when I surrender to God.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Please pray for me. My heart wants to, but my head doesn&#8217;t. The voice of the eating disorder&#8211;the enemy&#8217;s voice&#8211;is so loud right now. It&#8217;s like walking through fog. I can&#8217;t see the details. I want to know exactly
                        how much weight I&#8217;ll have to gain, and how it will affect my shape. Will I get to a comfortable place with my new weight and shape? Will I accept and in turn learn to like my new body? I can&#8217;t see my answers, but I can trust God will be
                        there for me even in the fog.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://www.kristylahoda.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/NJ-Tree-in-Fog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-567" alt="NJ Tree in Fog" src="http://www.kristylahoda.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/NJ-Tree-in-Fog-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300"/></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Being okay with what I look like no matter what my weight and shape&#8230; I was just starting to be more comfortable with where I&#8217;m at shape-wise. God hasn&#8217;t yet burned out my impurities in this area though because I obviously feel
                        more comfortable with myself when I drop weight and hang out at the bottom of my allowable weight range. But I know this is another big answer for me in my healing journey.</p>
                    <p>As I walk in recovery and write my books, God heals me. I had no idea what my
                        <em>conclusion</em>
                        would be for my first book, but God had me walk out the healing. And as I walked it out, He gave me the answer for the first
                        <em>and
                        </em>second books (it will be a two-book series). I&#8217;m not to the point of healing book two will story, but I think it&#8217;s cool He&#8217;s given me the answer. But here&#8217;s where the fight gets excruciating. He&#8217;s starting to have
                        me live it out. I want to help others heal. He&#8217;s showing me, it&#8217;s not enough to know the answer, I have to live it. Go figure.</p>
                    <p>So am I excelling? In accordance with Merriam Webster, I am only when the healthy part of me is louder than the eating disordered part of me. It&#8217;s like i&#8217;m split and the healthy half is competing with the sick half. However, in
                        accordance with God, I am because I&#8217;m on the journey with Him. And that&#8217;s enough.</p>
                    <p>&#8220;The Lord makes firm the steps of the one who delights in him; though he may stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his hand.&#8221; Ps 37:23-24</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>God, I know you want me to live in recovery. Help me to want Your will more than my own.</em>
                    </p>
