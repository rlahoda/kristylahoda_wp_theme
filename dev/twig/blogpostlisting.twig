            <p>Let’s talk about what’s on the inside versus outside of a person. I have a few things on my heart today. The first is my sister-in-law and her family who lost their brother/son in an accident a year ago today. I didn’t know him well,
                but I love his sister and his parents. They’ve been family for a long time. They’re good people, and they neither deserve nor want to be on the journey they’re on.</p>

            <p>Beginning the week before Christmas week, I started struggling again. I didn’t want to post because I didn’t want to be vulnerable. The truth is, recovery is hell.</p>

            <h3 class="card__small__header">What Does it Mean To Be Made in the Image of Christ?</h3>
            <p>I read an amazing book for my Vineyard Institute Biblical Metanarrative class called The Biblical Metanarrative: One God, One Plan, One Story by my late professor, Bill Jackson. Near the end, he includes a long, anonymous quote which
                just takes my breath away. It’s about what it means to be made into the image of Christ. As you will see, this takes death to self, spiritually speaking. Before you read this, ask yourself if you live for yourself or for God or
                both.</p>
